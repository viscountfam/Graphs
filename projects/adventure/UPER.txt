Understand

Given a pre-generated graph consisting of 500 rooms.
fill out traversal_path that will allow a player to visit every room in the maze at least once

important commands

player.current_room.id - gets the id of the room the player is currently in
player.current_room.get_exits() - returns a list of the directions that contain an get_exits
player.travel(direction) - if the direction is valid it sets the players current room to the next 
and you cannot move in that directions

we want to create a graph of where each room leads

this is what the initial entry looks like
{
    0: {'n': '?', 's': '?' 'w': '?', 'e': '?'}
}

when were done we want a list of 500 dictionaries
[
    0: {'n': 3 's': 5, 'w': 9, 'e': 4}
    1: {'n': 3 's': 5, 'w': 9, 'e': 4}
]

Plan

we could start by using a randomly selected direction
and then switch to using a bfs to get the rest
